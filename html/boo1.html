            <h1>What is C#</h1>
            <h2>: sanjai</h2>
            <p>C# (pronounced "C-sharp") is a modern, high-level programming language designed and developed by Microsoft. It was introduced in 2000 as a part of Microsoft's .NET Framework and is now widely used for developing a variety of applications, including desktop and mobile applications, web applications, and games.
              </p>
          
            <p>C# is an object-oriented language, meaning that it is based on the concept of objects, which are instances of classes. It also supports features such as garbage collection, type safety, and cross-language compatibility. C# code is compiled into an intermediate language called Common Intermediate Language (CIL), which can be executed by the .NET Framework.</p>
          
            <p>Some of the key features of C# include its simplicity, expressiveness, and readability. Its syntax is similar to that of other C-style languages like C++ and Java, making it easy to learn for programmers familiar with those languages. C# also provides strong support for building multithreaded and asynchronous applications, making it a popular choice for developing high-performance software.</p>
