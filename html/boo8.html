            <h1>Basic syntax</h1>
            <h2>: sanjai</h2>
            <p>The basic syntax of C# can be broken down into the following components:
                
              </p>
          
            <p>1. Namespaces:<br>
              Namespaces are used to organize code into logical groups and avoid naming conflicts.<br>
              using System;

            
            </p>
          
            <p>2. Class declaration:<br>
              A class is a container for data and methods that operate on that data. C# programs typically have at least one class.<br>
              public class MyClass<br>
              {<br>
                // class members<br>
              }

            
            </p>
          
            <p>3. Method declaration:<br>
              A method is a block of code that performs a specific task. Methods are defined within a class.<br>
              public void MyMethod()<br>
              {<br>
                // method body<br>
              }

              </p>
          
            <p>4. Variables:<br>
              Variables are used to store data in a program. C# is a strongly-typed language, which means that variables must be declared with a specific data type.<br>
              int myInt = 42;<br>
              string myString = "Hello, world!";


            
            </p>
        
          
            <p>5. Statements:<br>
              Statements are instructions that perform a specific action, such as assigning a value to a variable or calling a method.<br>
              myInt = 10;<br>
              Console.WriteLine(myString);

            
            </p>
            <p>6. Comments:<br>
              Comments are used to add notes to code that explain what it does or why it was written.<br>
              // This is a single-line comment<br>
              /* This is a<br>
                multi-line comment */


            
            </p>
          
            <p>7. Program entry point:<br>
              Every C# program has a special method called Main, which is the entry point for the program. This method is called when the program is executed.<br>
              public static void Main()<br>
              {<br>
                // program body<br>
              }


            
            </p>

            <p>These are the basic elements of C# syntax, but there are many more advanced features and concepts that can be used to write complex programs.
            
            </p>
